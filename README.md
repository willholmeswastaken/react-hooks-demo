# React-hooks-demo
This is a repo to demonstrate the differences in react hooks mainly between useState and useReducer.

In short:
UseState is great for having a state mechanism for a small amount of data.
UseReducer is great for having a state mechanism for a large / growing amount of data.

UseReducer is great for components that will grow over time and need maintaining. 

This demo also showcases the useEffect hook which is the equivalent to the class component version of 'ComponentDidMount' and 'ComponentDidUpdate'
